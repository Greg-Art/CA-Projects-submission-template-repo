## Project Description
A time series is a sequence of data points that are indexed and ordered chronologically over time. Time series data can be observed at regular or irregular intervals and can be collected over any time period, ranging from seconds to decades or even centuries. Time series data can be univariate (i.e., a single variable is recorded over time) or multivariate (i.e., multiple variables are recorded over time).Favorita Corporation is an Ecuadorian company that creates and invests in the commercial, industrial and real estate areas. Its subsidiaries have activities in six countries in the region, including Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Colombia, Costa Rica and Chile. They offer the best products, services and experiences in an efficient, sustainable and responsible way to improve the quality of life. 

The aim of this project is to forecast the unit sales of the products across different stores. This is to optimize their inventory management , marketing strategies  and pricing  decisions. To achieve this results, we employed the use of time series in collaboration with different machine learning algorithms via the CRISP-DM framework. 

The objective of this analysis is to select the best prediction model from the different ML algorithms tested. This model will be the solution to be adopted by the company to help Favorita Corporation make insightful decisions in relation to their retail sales ,promotion and customer statisfaction.
